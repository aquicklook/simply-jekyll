Mathematics is the bedrock of any contemporary discipline of science. It is no surprise then that, almost all the techniques of modern data science including all of the machine learning have some deep mathematical underpinning or the other.

Sometimes, as a data scientist or even as a junior analyst on the team, you have to learn those foundational mathematics by heart to use or apply the techniques properly, other times you can just get by using an API or the out-of-box algorithm.

However, having a solid understanding of the math behind the cool algorithm you are using to create meaningful product recommendation for your users, will never hurt you. More often than not, it should give you an edge among your peers and make you more confident.

In order not to lose the coherence between topics and itself, the content will be presented systematically and explicitly[[I have a deep conviction that mathematics is about ideas, not just formulas and algorithms, and not just theorems and proofs. Therefore, the introduction of mathematical ideas, describing them with visual images and presenting examples that have been applied in practice in addition to theoretical basis will give everyone insight and more vivid.::rsn]] to help people step by step remove barriers and act more deliberately when researching about data science.
